# 🏦 Credit Scoring Model

This project demonstrates a credit scoring model developed using Python on Google Colab. The model analyzes customer data to predict credit risk, supporting decision-making in financial applications.

## 📘 Project Overview

The notebook contains:
- Data loading and exploration
- Preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model building and evaluation
- Visualizations of results

You can run this project entirely in **Google Colab** without any local setup.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Open in Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JQFjSgjGhNyBN-7_eHudb8Dx4s27yCTS?usp=sharing)

Requirements

Python >= 3.7
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
(If using Colab, dependencies are pre-installed.)


📈 Model Overview
The credit scoring model uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to predict the probability that a customer will default.

Typical workflow:
Data preprocessing
Splitting into train/test sets
Model training
Evaluation (accuracy, ROC AUC)
Visualization of performance metrics

✨ Example Outputs

Confusion Matrix
ROC Curve
